# CSE111-Project
This is a project created by Julian Olaviano and Armando Sanchez for our CSE111 - Database Systems class. 

## Project Description
Our project is based on tracking personal parking and permits within the UC Merced parking lots. Users (students, staff, faculty, guests) are able toâ€¦
- Sign in/Create accounts
- Obtain permits
- Extend Permits
- Look at Map/Zone
- Track what spot your vehicle is in
- Track what spots are available

# Phase 1
Determine the project requirements and write the specification. Design the database layer. You are required to provide the use case specification as 
UML diagrams, the database design as E/R diagrams, the conversion from the E/R diagrams to relations, and the database SQL schema.

# Phase 2
Implement the database layer. By this time you should be done with writing queries/updates/views in SQL. Design the user interface and provide a 
prototype of the entire system.

# Phase 3
The system is completely implemented, optimized, and tested. You are required to give a presentation/demo of your work and to hand-in a report of 
the project containing the design documents.
